You can stay with the 8k ROM or optional use the 16k ROM with CALL VOLMGR in DSR.

To use the 16k ROM you will need remove 5v from pin 26 of 27c128,
Then add jumper to pin 7 of 74ls259. (Right now Pin 7 is not connected on the 74ls259)

The new PCB already has this change.
I have the old PCBs.
I bent pin 26 up and wire wrapped to the 74ls259.
